# warehouse_database
I have gained experience in the e-commerce sector as an employee, and as an ICT engineering student, I have undertaken a school project involving a monolithic warehouse database created in MySQL. I have supplied a MySQL forward engineering script for this project. This database is well-suited for a small business; however, for larger businesses, it would be more prudent to implement it using microservices that can be scaled up to meet increased demand during peak seasons such as Christmas.

Please ensure that this solution is tailored to your specific needs and that appropriate security measures are in place. I cannot be held responsible for any issues that may arise from its use.

I have created views that are used often.
- A view showing all products with their categories
- A view showing stock information for all products
- A view showing total sales for each product
- A view showing all customers and their total orders
